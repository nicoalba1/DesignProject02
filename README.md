Design Project #2 for AE 353: Aerospace Controls

Goal: Design a controller that will make a robot arm move to a sequence of points in space. The catch: there are 2 joints and only one actuator.

*Also created a small peicewise function for movement as proof of concept* 


To run:
Open Files in MATLAB

In the command window run: DesignProblem02('Controller','diagnostics',true)

File Descriptions:
------------------
-Main.pdf: PDF of submitted report.

-DesignProblem02: Provided simulation that creates a robot arm with random initial conditions of movement.

-Controller: Controller that is called by DesignProblem02 to control the actuators.

-Analytics: Workbench

-loadData: plots data of movement (also shown when diagnostics are turned on)

-data.mat Data generated from Designproblem01
